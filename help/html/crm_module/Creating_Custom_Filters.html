              Filters, or views, are used to separate desired records from the
              stack of other records, and capture them in a different bucket.
              For instance, you can quickly filter all the records for a sector
              or sub sector. You can also perform operations on the filtered
              records like mass edit, delete, sending emails etc.

              This tutorial is designed to explain how filters are created in PE
              Front Office. We'll explain you how filters can be created in
              Contacts module. You can follow the same steps to create filters
              on other modules.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Click <b>Contacts</b> tab. The process is same for other
                modules: Organizations, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Click <b>Create Filter</b> link located above the List view.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <br />
              <a href="" class="image"
                ><img
                  class="images"
                  src="../../images/crm_images/creating_custome_filters_2.png"
                  width="100%"
              /></a>
            </p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <dl>
              <dd>
                3. You'll be navigated to create views of a filter's page.
                Provide a label to your filter in <b>View Name</b> field
              </dd>
              <dd>
                4. Select desired columns you would like to see in a custom
                view. You can only select up to 9 columns.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              <img
                class="images"
                src="../../images/crm_images/creating_custome_filters_3.png"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <dl>
              <dd>
                5. You'll need to specify conditions to filter only specific
                entities that you would like to have in your custom view. The
                process of applying conditions to filter desired records has
                been made simple.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              <br />
              <img
                class="images"
                alt="ContactFilter-AdvancedSearch.png"
                src="../../images/crm_images/creating_custome_filters_4.png"
                width="100%"
                height=""
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              1. <b>All Conditions&#160;:</b> Filters records based on AND
              condition.
            </p>
            <pre>
For instance, 
Condition 1
AND
Condition 2
AND
Condition 3

Displays the results if and only if ALL conditions are matched. If one condition is failed, other queries will not be executed.</pre
            >
            <p>
              2. <b>Any Conditions&#160;:</b> Filters records based on OR
              condition.
            </p>
            <pre>
For instance, 
Condition 1
OR
Condition 2
OR
Condition 3

Displays the results if at-least ONE condition is matched. If one query is failed, other queries will be executed.</pre
            >
            <p><br /></p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
              <p><strong>Notes!</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  By default, AND condition is enabled between
                  <b>ALL conditions</b> and <b>ANY conditions</b>. This will
                  help you in grouping the two conditions, all together.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can also filter the records on custom and default date
                  fields. The conditions are dynamic. For instance,
                  <b>Today</b> as filter condition will display all the records
                  on current day. It will not display the same records tomorrow.
                  It will display the records of present day instead.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can provide existing or custom criteria to filter records.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p><br /></p>

              Now that you've successfully completed creating a filter, it's
              time to fit it to your business requirements. You have a wide
              variety of options to get the most out of the filter you've
              created.

              <dd>
                You might have thousands of records in your PE Front Office. You
                don't deal with all of them. You can create filters and set the
                filter default so that you can view only most important records.
                By clicking on the check-box, the filter will be made default
                for you and other users in your PE Front Office account.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <ul>
              <li><b>List in Metrics</b></li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
              <dd>
                You can have details of your filter right on your home page,
                too. Enable the check-box to view details of your filter in
                <b>Key Metrics</b> widget on the home page.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Set as Public</b></li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
              <dd>
                Enable the check-box to make the filter visible for all users
                across your PE Front Office account. If a non-admin user enables
                this option, the filter will be in a pending state until admin
                approves it. Admin users can approve the filter by clicking on
                <i class="icon-ok"></i> icon next to the filter.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <dd>
                6. Once you're done, click on <b>Save</b> button. I hope that
                your filter has delivered results for you.
