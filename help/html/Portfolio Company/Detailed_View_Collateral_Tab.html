                Unsecured/Others Collaterals, Collaterals Summary. Collateral is something you put up as a security.Collateral is a
                property or other asset that a borrower offers as a way for a lender to secure the loan. If the borrower stops
                making the promised loan payments, the lender can seize the collateral to recoup its losses. Since collateral offers
                some security to the lender should the borrower fail to pay back the loan, loans that are secured by collateral
                typically have lower interest rates than unsecured loans.

            <p>
                <b>Unsecured/Others Collaterals : </b>An unsecured Collaterals is a Collaterals that is issued and supported only by
                the borrower's creditworthiness, rather than by any type of collateral. Because unsecured loans, sometimes referred
                to as signature loans or personal loans, are obtained without the use of property as collateral, the terms of such
                loans, including approval and receipt, are most often contingent on the borrower's credit score. Borrowers must
                generally have high credit ratings to be approved for certain unsecured loans.<br>
                Unsecured loans are the reverse of secured loans. They include things like credit cards, student loans, or personal
                (signature) loans. Lenders take more of a risk by making this loan, because there is no asset to recover in case of
                default. This is why the interest rates are higher. If you are turned down for unsecured credit, you may still be
                able to obtain secured loans. But you must have something of value that can be used as collateral.</br>
